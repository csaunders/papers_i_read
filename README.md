# Papers I Read

I'm looking to expand my horizons and learn more and one of the ways I've heard to
do that is by simply reading research papers. Considering how I haven't read any papers
since that time I had to read *one* for an info retrieval class, I figured this is a good
way to do it.

I'm really looking for somewhere to put all this code, and open sourcing it is fun.

The papers are just taken off of [papers we love](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love) and implemented here. The goal is to try
pulling it off in a bunch of languages, but even after my first one (which might be over-complicated)
I'm starting to question how realistic that is.
